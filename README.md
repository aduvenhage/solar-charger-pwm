# solar-charger-pwm
Work in progress lead-acid solar charge controller...

Using circuitlab (https://www.circuitlab.com/circuit/vx6fj82sf5gy/12v-solar-charger-pwm/) for basic testing of circuit.

I originally designed this as part of a LoRa based wiresless sensor, but I decided to go back to 3.7V with 12V boost conversion for that project.

This project will hopefully grow into a functional PWM lead-acid solar charger and maybe an MPPT solar charger if I have time.
